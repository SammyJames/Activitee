Activitee
=========

![Example](http://i.imgur.com/6vwcJpt.jpg)

Activitee is inspired and based upon ActivityTracker (Red5's default tracker). I wanted to be able to change the layout and font sizes and just kinda spiraled downwards from there. 

Activitee is also an attempt at some OOP lua.


Known Issues:
-------------

* Goals don't work (tracking things from the crafting window)
* There aren't any settings yet (I'm adding them where fit)
